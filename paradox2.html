            <h2 class="head">1. Raven Paradox</h2>
        <div class="pr"><p>The raven paradox, also known as Hempel's paradox, Hempel's ravens, or rarely the 
        paradox of indoor ornithology, is a paradox arising from the question of what is 
        supposed to be evidence for a statement. Observing objects that are neither black nor
        ravens may formally increase the likelihood that all ravens are black even though, 
        these observations are unrelated.<br><br>
        The paradox is as follows - <br><br></p></div>

        <div class="statement"><b><i>"(1) All ravens are black.<br>
        (2) If something is not black, then it is not a raven."</i></b></div><br>

        <div class="pr"><p>In all circumstances where (2) is true, (1) is also trueâ€”and likewise, in all 
        circumstances where (2) is false (i.e., if a world is imagined in which something that 
        was not black, yet was a raven, existed), (1) is also false. Given a general 
        statement such as all ravens are black, a form of the same statement that refers to 
        a specific observable instance of the general class would typically be considered to
        proving evidence for that general statement. Here the information is produced
        about raven by looking at any object which isn't a raven</div><br><br>

        <h2 class="head">2. Bootstrap Paradox</h2>
        <div class="pr">The Bootstrap Paradox is again related to concept of time travel. The statement of 
        Bootstrap Paradox says that -</div><br><br>

        <div class="statement"><b><i>"One day you find a book at your doorstep reguarding how to build the time
        machine. You used that book and made a time machine after 10 years. Then you decided 
        to find the origin of the book. So using the time machine you travelled back 10 years
        to find the origin of the book. But instead you kept the book at the doorstep and 
        eventually gave it to the past YOU. So in this whole case the origin of the book is 
        unknown and yet it still exists but its now trapped in a time loop."</i></b></div><br><br>
        
        <div class="pr">In this paradox we are dealing with the concept of time travel. As the statement says
        the origin of the book remains unclear. As you recieved the book from the future you.
        The future might have been recieved the book his future and so on. But now its stuck
        in a time loop. If you decided not to travel back in time and give the book to past
        YOU it'll create a paradox similar to grandfather paradox like if you didn't go to the
        past then you would never recieve the book. If you never recieved the book then you 
        never build the time machine and if you never build the time machine you would never
        go in past to give the book. Like that. The Netflix series</div>

        is also based on the same paradox.<br><br>

        <h2 class="head">3. Crorodile Paradox</h2>
        <div class="pr"> crocodile paradox, also known as crocodile sophism, is a paradox in logic in the 
        same family of paradoxes as the liar paradox. The Crorodile Paradox says that -</div> <br>

        <div class="statement"><p><b><i>"One day a crorodile abducts a kid. His mother request the crocodile the release
        the kid. Crocodile says "You have to tell what i am thinking about the release of child 
        that is am I thinking to release him or not.? If you guessed correctly I'll release 
        him." Here is the paradox.
        <ul>
            <li>If the Mother replies "Yes" to the question of crocodile and
        the crocodile was not thinking to release the kid then they both disagree and kid 
        would not be released</li><br>
            <li>
                If the mother replies "No" to the question, then crocodile won't release the 
                kid and keep him even though he didn't want to."</li>
        </ul></i></b></p></div>

        <div class="pr"><p>Here its all about the perception and how we understand the meaning of world. In 
        first case where the mother says Yes to the question, the crocodile may lie and say
        that he wasn't thinking to release him in order to create a disagreement and as per
        the terms he said he'll keep the kid.</p>
        <p>Whereas in the other case where the mother says No to the question the crocodile 
        may again lie but this time he'll take the answer of the mother as an Order rather 
        than as a statement. So reguardless of what he's thinking he'll keep the kid
        irrespective of his terms.</p></div>

        <h2 class="head">4. Twin Earth Paradox</h2>
        <div class="pr"><p>The twin earth paradox deals with the concept of Multiverse. Here's what it says -</p></div>
        
        <div class="statement"><p><b><i>"Consider another Earth as Earth-2. All elements that we have on Earth are same
        on Earth-2, except it doesn't have what we call Water(H<sup>2</sup>O).Instead of H
        <sup>2</sup>O, they the liquid XYZ (we call their liquid as XYZ). Those people from 
        Earth-2 call their liquid as water. So if both the Earth's are refering to water are 
        they refering to same thing ?"</i></b></p></div>

        <div class="pr"><p>Twin Earth is a thought experiment proposed by philosopher Hilary Putnam in his 
        papers "Meaning and Reference" (1973) and "The Meaning of 'Meaning'" (1975). It is 
        meant to serve as an illustration of his argument for semantic externalism, or the 
        view that the meanings of words are not purely psychological. The Twin Earth thought 
        xperiment was one of three examples that Putnam offered in support of semantic 
        externalism, the other two being what he called the Aluminum-Molybdenum case and the 
        Beech-Elm case. Since the publication of these cases, numerous variations on the 
        thought experiment have been proposed by philosophers.</p></div>

        <h2 class="head">5. Barabar Paradox</h2>
        <div class="pr"><p>The Barber paradox states that - </p></div>
        <div class="statement"><p><b><i>"There is a barber in a city. He is only allowed to shave the one's who 
        doesn't shave themself. Now the question is does the barber shave himself ?"</i></b></p></div>

        <div class="pr"><p>Talking about the paradox it mainly arises about the barber's beard. If the barber
        doesn't shave himself, he should. Here we ignore the rule made by the barber. And if the 
        does shave himself then he shouldn't as per the rule. So this agains comes as how we 
        make up the situation and what do we priortise here - the growth of excessive beard or 
        the rule.</p></div>

        <br><b>Here it shows the question that does the barber shave himself ?</b><br><br>    
        <b>Keep in mind that Russell's Paradox is same as barber's paradox. Just the 
        Russell Paradox is explain with the help of set theory in mathematics.</b><br>
